# ACML-2023-FPOGD-Code

## Prerequisites
Before running this code, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
cd your-repo

    Install the required Python packages using pip:

bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

    Download the dataset you want to use and place it in the specified directory:

bash

# Replace 'path_to_data' with the actual path to your data
cp your_dataset.csv path_to_data/

Usage

    Load the data:

bash

python data_loader.py

    Run the main algorithm:

bash

python main.py

    View the results:

bash

# This will generate a plot of the results
python plot_results.py

Configuration

You can modify the following parameters in the main.py file to customize the behavior of the code:

    dataname: Name of the dataset to be used.
    s: Value of 's' parameter.
    epochs: Number of training epochs.
    early_stop: Early stopping criteria.
    path_to_data: Path to the dataset.

Make sure to update the values accordingly.
Results

The code generates a plot showing the AUC (Area Under the Curve) over time for the specified dataset. The x-axis represents time in seconds, and the y-axis represents the AUC value. The legend in the plot indicates the algorithm used.

You can analyze the plot to understand the performance of the algorithm on the given dataset.
